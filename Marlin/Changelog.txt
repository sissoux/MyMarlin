Updated 13-8-2020 [V2.0.X.7] - Z-Tool Offset Bug Fixes
-Fixed issue where Z-offset tool may not reflect the actual z changes when adjusting real-time
-Added "Re-Home Z" button in Z-offset tool so user can make changes and test real Z immediately.
-It's very important to heat up nozzle to 180-200 while using Z-offset Tool (if there is PLA in nozzle) Else the Z-offset will vary a lot depending on the leftover material stuck on nozzle tip.
-Enabled ADVANCED_PAUSE_FEATURE

Updated 1-8-2020 [V2.0.X.6B] - Major Update.
-Updated BLTouch to use 5 pins port provided by the board. Replacing Z Stop Switch is no longer required. (If you still have your old wiring done based on our older guide you will need to change it in order to flash 2.0.x.6 firmware) We believe this is a step forward as it gives you the flexibility to switch to other firmware without the hassle of changing the wiring.
-EEPROM is now saved within the board instead of SD card.
-Changing Z-offset now works when printing. Will be reflected immediately. Store configuration if you want it to be persistent across reboots.
-Pausing works on the printer now. Which means file like CHEP's leveling gcode will work.
-Added white borders to Tune/Pause/Stop buttons
-Improved Z Offset tool (Remember to pre-heat your nozzle while using this as any remaining material stuck on nozzle tip might interfere with the result when you gauge with A4 paper)
-Corrected most labels and typos in DWIN UI
-Updated Marlin to the latest build (1st August 2020)

Updated 28-7-2020 [V2.0.X.5]

Updated 25-7-2020 [V2.0.X.4]
-Adjusted max bed size back to 220 as some users are facing issue where it's printing outside of edge. 
-Previous version was using value of 220 + 15 as it helps BLTouch to probe nearer to edge for better mesh output.
